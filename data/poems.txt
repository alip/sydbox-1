00:43:33  pipping> There was a sailor from Brighton
00:43:33  pipping> Who remarked to his girl, "You're a tight one."
00:43:33  pipping> She replied, "Bless my soul,
00:43:34  pipping> You're in the wrong hole!
00:43:34  pipping> There's plenty of room in the right one!"

17:58:29 < kimrhh> Fire! Fire! Ferocious fire!
17:58:30 < kimrhh> You restless wall of flame.
17:58:30 < kimrhh> Fire! Fire! Roaring higher!
17:58:30 < kimrhh> Your fury to never tame.

19:53:02 < pipping> There was an old man
19:53:02 < pipping> From Peru, whose lim'ricks all
19:53:02 < pipping> Look'd like haiku. He
19:53:02 < pipping>  
19:53:02 < pipping> Said with a laugh "I
19:53:02 < pipping> Cut them in half, the pay is
19:53:03 < pipping> Much better for two."

14:06:21 < pipping> There was a young maid from Aberystwyth,
14:06:22 < pipping> Who took grain to the mill to make grist with.
14:06:22 < pipping>      The miller's son, Jack,
14:06:22 < pipping>      Threw her flat on her back,
14:06:22 < pipping> And united the organs they pissed with.

00:23:23 < sepek> In the darkest night I sneak to the mirror /
00:23:23 < sepek> I look inside and see the clown. /
00:23:23 < sepek> The more he laughs louder the more I resent /
00:23:24 < sepek> Oh dark world of pain and horror

10:45:32 < kimrhh> med speidende Öie,

13:02:08 < SardemFF7> I love this one https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Fleurs_du_mal/1857/Le_Vin_de_l%E2%80%99assassin

Charles Baudelaire
Les Fleurs du mal (1857)
Poulet-Malassis et de Broise, 1857 (pp. 233-235).

LE VIN DE L’ASSASSIN

Ma femme est morte, je suis libre !
Je puis donc boire tout mon saoul.
Lorsque je rentrais sans un sou,
Ses pleurs me déchiraient la fibre.

Autant qu’un roi je suis heureux ;
L’air est pur, le ciel admirable.
— Nous avions un été semblable
Lorsque j’en devins amoureux !

— L’horrible soif qui me déchire
Aurait besoin pour s’assouvir
D’autant de vin qu’en peut tenir
Son tombeau ; — ce n’est pas peu dire :

Je l’ai jetée au fond d’un puits,
Et j’ai même poussé sur elle
Tous les pavés de la margelle.
— Je l’oublierai si je le puis !

Au nom des serments de tendresse,
Dont rien ne peut nous délier,
Et pour nous réconcilier
Comme au beau temps de notre ivresse,

J’implorai d’elle un rendez-vous,
Le soir, sur une route obscure,
Elle y vint ! folle créature !
— Nous sommes tous plus ou moins fous !

Elle était encore jolie,
Quoique bien fatiguée ! et moi,
Je l’aimais trop ; — voilà pourquoi
Je lui dis : sors de cette vie !

Nul ne peut me comprendre. Un seul
Parmi ces ivrognes stupides
Songea-t-il dans ses nuits turpides
À faire du vin un linceul ?

Cette crapule invulnérable
Comme les machines de fer
Jamais, ni l’été ni l’hiver,
N’a connu l’amour véritable,

Avec ses noirs enchantements,
Son cortége infernal d’alarmes,
Ses fioles de poison, ses larmes,
Ses bruits de chaîne et d’ossements !

— Me voilà libre et solitaire !
Je serai ce soir ivre-mort ;
Alors, sans peur et sans remord,
Je me coucherai sur la terre,

Et je dormirai comme un chien !
Le chariot aux lourdes roues
Chargé de pierres et de boues,
Le vagon enragé peut bien

Écraser ma tête coupable
Ou me couper par le milieu,
Je m’en moque comme de Dieu,
Du Diable ou de la Sainte Table !

Thanks Ali, here's some Vogon poetry for you:

Oh flundered gruntbuggly,Donallitude
Thy micturations are to me
As plurdled donally
On a lurgid bee
That mordiously hath bitled out
Its earted grabatiously
Into a rancid festering [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts
And living glupules frart and slipulate
Like jowling meated liverslime
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes
And hooptiously drangle me
With crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon
See if I don't.

THE SAD SHEPHERD

THERE was a man whom Sorrow named his Friend,
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
And humming Sands, where windy surges wend:
And he called loudly to the stars to bend
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Cried out, i{Dim sea, hear my most piteous story.!}
The sea Swept on and cried her old cry still,
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.
He fled the persecution of her glory
And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,
The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,
And thought, I i{will my heavy story tell}
i{Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send}
i{Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;}
i{And my own talc again for me shall sing,}
i{And my own whispering words be comforting,}
i{And lo! my ancient burden may depart.}
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.

13:03:14 < alip> kloeri: is it impolite for me to mention that you owe me a poem?
13:03:29 < kloeri> haha no, not at all :)
13:12:32 < kloeri> alip: I really like http://www.lyrics007.com/Porcupine%20Tree%20Lyrics/Radioactive%20Toy%20Lyrics.html lately

PORCUPINE TREE - RADIOACTIVE TOY LYRICS

Run through forests on a hot Summer day
Trying to break down walls of numbing pain

Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toy

Taste the water from a stream of running death
Eat the apple and cough a dying breath

Feel the sun burning through your black skin
Pour me into a hole, inform my next of kin

Run through graveyards on a dusty Winter day
Spit the dirt out and try to say

Subject: [PATCH] x11.graveyard: Bury openmotif in the graveyard. Epitaph
 follows.
Organization: Pink Floyd

A graphical user interface toolkit you were.
When first we met in 1997, I thought you were swell,
abandoned you soon were, for LessTif came to make me purr.
Back you made your way from the dead (which was quite well!),
Openmotif beat LessTif and did not cost a dime,
and still, today we hear your death knell's last chime.

ক্লান্তি আমার ক্ষমা করো প্রভু,
          পথে যদি পিছিয়ে পড়ি কভু॥
    এই-যে হিয়া থরোথরো কাঁপে আজি এমনতরো
এই বেদনা ক্ষমা করো, ক্ষমা করো, ক্ষমা করো প্রভু॥
          এই দীনতা ক্ষমা করো প্রভু,
          পিছন-পানে তাকাই যদি কভু।
    দিনের তাপে রৌদ্রজ্বালায় শুকায় মালা পূজার থালায়,
সেই ম্লানতা ক্ষমা করো, ক্ষমা করো, ক্ষমা করো প্রভু॥

The Flower and The Thunderstorm

As a flower during a thunderstorm, I struggle to keep my poise against your heavy rain,
The same natural element which nourishes me

Punisher and savior
Providing life and yet, death in your downpour looms

There is an unspoken agreement between the two of us

And as your drops fall diligently,
They find shelter in the gentleness of my petals,

My supple roots rejoice,
And as flower, I thrive in awe of the shear strength and vastness of your storm.

23:36:17 < woutershep> alip: it seems bugreports must come with a poem nowadays, so: http://trickytank.com/words/thegoat.htm

The Goat

One day there was a goat,
Who really liked to eat oats.
He ran around and played all day,
being all happy, and gay.
Next a dark cloud came near,
and the little billy, drank some beer.
Drunk he was, so he picked a fight,
so that little dark cloud, went amazingly bright.
Down came a thunder bolt, at that goat,
and destroyed much more, than just his coat.
The cloud ran away, back to the ocean.
The goat applied, some antiseptic lotion.
That little goat, was all scratched and bruised,
so he figured, his beer was far too brewed!
Now that goat, will be more nice,
and eat those oats, with sugar and spice.

04:55:48 < eternaleye> There once was a young man named Syd
04:55:49 < eternaleye> And sandboxing was what he did
04:55:49 < eternaleye> But using ptrace
04:55:49 < eternaleye> Forced him into a race
04:55:49 < eternaleye> Thanks, Seccomp! He later would bid.

11:53:02 < ivanm> There once was a hacker named alip,
11:53:03 < ivanm> The sandboxing problem, he thought he could whip.
11:53:03 < ivanm> Whilst at first he was tickled pink[trace]
11:53:03 < ivanm> He then started to think,
11:53:03 < ivanm> And gave the old version the snip!

22:12:51 < moben> alip: I just upgraded to sydbox-1 and it is working so far, so here is your poem:

My dog is quite hip
Except when he takes a dip
He looks like a fool
when he jumps in the pool
and reminds me of a sinking ship

23:16:41 < fauxmight> alip: sydbox scm (not 0-scm) seems to have magically solved a host of sydbox related difficulties in building icedtea7. Many thanks
23:19:41 < alip> fauxmight: it is not magic, it's 2 years of work and you owe me a poem!
23:19:55  * alip opens vodka
23:33:12 < fauxmight> alip: just for you: nosocomia.com/tmp/alip.txt

Alip! Alip!
Strong he be! Strong he be!

Have some vodka; have some Floyd
With new sydbox I'll ne'er be annoyed

Once 'twas terrible building icedtea7
Now a days it feels like heaven

Alas for alip there remains a sadness:
This lousy poet's verses of badness

A Nonsensical Sonnet

Running in the sun and hiding away
We are two immortals, in human bonds
Don’t know where I’ll be at the break of day
I’ll finish this work at the gates of dawn

But now we are both blind, it must be said
You’re lovely and you really must know it
Come let me rest my fingers on your head
I know this well, but still fear to show it

And hence I come to the end of my song
I don’t know why I tried this endeavor
Well, the lines at least will end before long
This blasted thing will haunt me forever

And here we stand, gazing softly at the moon
I hope now you’ll sing to a different tune

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
