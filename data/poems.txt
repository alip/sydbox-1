Poem:
	-- Pregnant

	drawing curtains
	hiding fetus
	behind venus
	all Night long
	let it flow
	into snow
	crystals in a row
	mothers will bow
	and swallow
	their unborn babies!

Poem:
	-- Blind

	I encouraged slavery
	against firefly’s bravery
	her light’s a cheap delivery
	Dark murders the scenery

	I bribed the sun
	to bring the dawn
	she’s crowned, no longer a pawn
	yet torn apart, no longer one

	I fooled the moon
	not to wake up soon
	behind my Eyes, her doom
	a dream, at the brightest noon

	above the shoulders of flowers
	the questions planted answers
	just what dissuaded the brightness
	from filling my eyes with tears?
